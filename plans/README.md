# Plans

This directory is the **micro-DAG of work** that bridges `specs/` (timeless: what should be true) to the running code (current: what is). Each plan declares a scope, the specs it implements, its dependencies, and concrete validation criteria.

If `specs/` is the architecture document, `plans/` is the project plan.

## Workflow

Documented in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md#plans). Briefly:

1. Add a plan to start new work. `status: planned` and `depends:` set.
2. Move to `in-progress` when starting.
3. Move to `done` when all validation criteria pass. Link the merged PR.
4. A plan implements specs that already exist. If specs need to change mid-plan, the spec change is its own PR before the plan continues.

## What plans are NOT

- **Not specs.** Specs say what should be true forever; plans say what to do now.
- **Not commits.** A plan produces several commits and typically one PR.
- **Not tickets.** Plans have a dependency graph and validation criteria; tickets are flatter, more granular, and live on GitHub.
- **Not roadmap entries.** A roadmap entry says "we will ship X by Y"; a plan says "here's the scope + how + validation for X."

## After spec-complete

Once the initial DAG completes, plans don't go away — they become the workflow for *every* future feature. New features get a spec change AND a new plan. The plan declares which spec sections it brings to code and how we'll know it's done.

Completed plans stay as historical record. Their merged-PR links + completed-validation criteria are the project's working memory.
